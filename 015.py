# Starting in the top left corner of a 2Ã—2 grid, and only being able to move to the
# right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
# How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?

# Answer: 137846528820


#from math import factorial
#n = 20
#print factorial(2*n)/(factorial(n)*factorial(n))
